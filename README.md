# CIT 281 Lab 04

## Overview  
Lab 04 introduced JavaScript object-oriented programming (OOP) using classes. I learned how to define your own custom classes, create instances (objects) from those classes, and use constructor functions and `this` to assign properties. The lab focused on writing reusable code using object structure, helping prepare you for larger, modular programs.

## Objectives  
- Define and use JavaScript classes
- Create constructor methods and assign object properties
- Instantiate objects using the `new` keyword
- Build methods inside classes for object behavior
- Understand the structure of `this`, `constructor`, and how methods work on class instances

## Deliverables  
- A `.js` file demonstrating:
  - A custom class with a constructor and multiple methods
  - Instantiated objects with varying properties
  - Use of those methods to output meaningful results

## What I Learned  
Lab 04 helped demystify the concept of JavaScript classes and how OOP principles apply in a real program. I now feel more comfortable defining constructors, instantiating objects, and attaching behavior to them through methods. These concepts are foundational for future labs and projects involving reusable code and larger systems.
